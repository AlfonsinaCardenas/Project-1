# Project 1 - Usability Testing Tool

The objective of this program was to create a Streamlit app to automate usability testing tasks.  

This tool includes:
  1. A home page explaining to the user what they will be doing.
  2. A consent page that lists the terms the user will need to accept to participate in the study.
  3. A demographics page that asks for the users' name, age, occupation, and their familiarity with similar tools.
  4. A task page that will give the users a task (in progress, placeholder for now). This includes a timer, a question about the success of the task, and a free space for the user to give feedback.
  5. An Exit Questionnaire page that will ask the user from a scale of 1-5, how satisfied they are with the task experience, and how difficult it was. They will also have a space to give further feedback.
  6. Lastly, we have a Report page that will summarize the users' answers. There are also some charts in the end to visualize this data.


Here is the Youtube video demonstrating and explaining how this tool works:
